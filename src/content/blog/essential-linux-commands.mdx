## Introduction

Whether you're doing penetration testing, playing CTFs, or just managing your system, mastering Linux commands is essential. This guide covers the most important commands you'll use daily.

## File System Navigation

### Basic Navigation

```bash
# Print working directory
pwd

# List files and directories
ls -la              # Detailed list with hidden files
ls -lh              # Human-readable file sizes
ls -lt              # Sort by modification time

# Change directory
cd /path/to/dir     # Absolute path
cd ..               # Parent directory
cd ~                # Home directory
cd -                # Previous directory
```

### Finding Files

```bash
# Find files by name
find / -name "flag.txt" 2>/dev/null

# Find files modified in last 7 days
find /home -mtime -7

# Find SUID binaries (privilege escalation)
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null

# Locate command (faster than find)
locate password.txt
updatedb            # Update locate database
```

## File Operations

### Reading Files

```bash
# Display file content
cat file.txt
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt

# Page through file
less file.txt       # Better for large files
more file.txt

# View first/last lines
head -n 20 file.txt     # First 20 lines
tail -n 50 file.txt     # Last 50 lines
tail -f /var/log/syslog # Follow log in real-time
```

### Searching in Files

```bash
# Search for pattern in files
grep "password" file.txt
grep -r "flag{" /home/user/     # Recursive search
grep -i "admin" file.txt         # Case-insensitive
grep -v "error" log.txt          # Invert match (exclude)

# Search with context
grep -A 5 "error" log.txt   # 5 lines after match
grep -B 3 "error" log.txt   # 3 lines before match
grep -C 2 "error" log.txt   # 2 lines before and after
```

## Network Commands

### Network Information

```bash
# Display network interfaces
ip addr
ifconfig

# Show routing table
ip route
netstat -rn

# DNS lookup
nslookup google.com
dig google.com
host google.com

# Check connectivity
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
traceroute google.com
```

### Network Scanning

```bash
# Scan ports with netcat
nc -zv 192.168.1.1 80-443

# Check listening ports
netstat -tulpn
ss -tulpn               # Modern alternative

# Download files
wget https://example.com/file.zip
curl -O https://example.com/file.txt
curl -X POST -d "data=value" https://api.example.com
```

## Process Management

```bash
# List running processes
ps aux
ps aux | grep nginx

# Interactive process viewer
top
htop                    # Better alternative

# Kill processes
kill 1234               # Kill by PID
killall firefox         # Kill by name
pkill -f python         # Kill by pattern

# Run in background
command &
nohup long_command &    # Keep running after logout
```

## File Permissions

```bash
# View permissions
ls -l file.txt
# Output: -rw-r--r-- (read/write for owner, read for group/others)

# Change permissions
chmod 644 file.txt      # rw-r--r--
chmod 755 script.sh     # rwxr-xr-x
chmod +x script.sh      # Add execute permission

# Change ownership
chown user:group file.txt
chown -R user:group /directory/

# SUID/SGID
chmod u+s binary        # Set SUID
chmod g+s directory     # Set SGID
```

## Text Processing

### Stream Editor (sed)

```bash
# Replace text
sed 's/old/new/' file.txt
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt          # Replace all occurrences
sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt       # Edit file in-place

# Delete lines
sed '/pattern/d' file.txt           # Delete matching lines
sed '5d' file.txt                   # Delete line 5
```

### AWK

```bash
# Print columns
awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt       # Print 1st and 3rd column
ps aux | awk '{print $2, $11}'      # Print PID and command

# Filter and print
awk '$3 > 50 {print $1, $3}' file.txt   # Print if 3rd column > 50
```

### Cut and Sort

```bash
# Cut columns
cut -d: -f1,3 /etc/passwd           # Get username and UID
cut -c1-10 file.txt                 # Get first 10 characters

# Sort and unique
sort file.txt
sort -n numbers.txt                 # Numeric sort
sort -r file.txt                    # Reverse sort
uniq file.txt                       # Remove duplicates
sort file.txt | uniq -c             # Count occurrences
```

## System Information

```bash
# System info
uname -a                # Kernel and system info
lsb_release -a          # Distribution info
hostnamectl             # Hostname and OS info

# Hardware info
lscpu                   # CPU info
lsmem                   # Memory info
lsblk                   # Block devices
lsusb                   # USB devices
lspci                   # PCI devices

# Disk usage
df -h                   # Disk space
du -sh /directory       # Directory size
du -h --max-depth=1     # Size of subdirectories
```

## Compression & Archives

```bash
# Tar archives
tar -czf archive.tar.gz /directory  # Create gzip archive
tar -xzf archive.tar.gz             # Extract gzip archive
tar -xzf archive.tar.gz -C /dest    # Extract to directory

# Zip files
zip -r archive.zip /directory
unzip archive.zip
unzip -l archive.zip                # List contents

# Other formats
gzip file.txt                       # Compress
gunzip file.txt.gz                  # Decompress
bzip2 file.txt
bunzip2 file.txt.bz2
```

## User Management

```bash
# User info
whoami                  # Current user
id                      # User ID and groups
w                       # Who is logged in
last                    # Login history

# Switch user
su - username
sudo -i                 # Root shell
sudo command            # Run as root

# User management (requires root)
useradd username
usermod -aG sudo username       # Add to sudo group
passwd username                 # Change password
userdel username               # Delete user
```

## Advanced Techniques

### One-Liners for CTF

```bash
# Find and read all .txt files
find . -name "*.txt" -exec cat {} \;

# Find SUID binaries and check GTFOBins
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -la

# Decode base64 encoded files
find . -type f -exec sh -c 'base64 -d {} 2>/dev/null | grep -a "flag{"' \;

# Monitor file changes
watch -n 1 'ls -la /tmp'

# Brute force with hydra
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.1.100
```

### Piping & Redirection

```bash
# Pipe output
command1 | command2
ps aux | grep nginx | awk '{print $2}'

# Redirection
command > output.txt        # Overwrite
command >> output.txt       # Append
command 2> error.txt        # Redirect stderr
command &> all.txt          # Redirect stdout and stderr
command < input.txt         # Input from file
```

## Useful Aliases

Add these to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Navigation
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'
alias ll='ls -alh'
alias la='ls -A'

# Safety
alias rm='rm -i'
alias cp='cp -i'
alias mv='mv -i'

# Common commands
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias ports='netstat -tulanp'
alias myip='curl ifconfig.me'

# Git shortcuts
alias gs='git status'
alias ga='git add'
alias gc='git commit -m'
alias gp='git push'
```

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Use man pages**: `man command` - Always read the manual
2. **Use tab completion**: Press Tab to autocomplete commands and paths
3. **Command history**: Use `Ctrl+R` to search command history
4. **Screen/Tmux**: Use terminal multiplexers for persistent sessions
5. **Learn regex**: Regular expressions are powerful for text processing

## Common Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` | Kill current process |
| `Ctrl+Z` | Suspend current process |
| `Ctrl+D` | Exit current shell |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear screen |
| `Ctrl+A` | Move to beginning of line |
| `Ctrl+E` | Move to end of line |
| `Ctrl+U` | Delete to beginning of line |
| `Ctrl+K` | Delete to end of line |
| `Ctrl+R` | Search command history |
| `!!` | Repeat last command |
| `!$` | Last argument of previous command |

## Conclusion

These commands form the foundation of Linux command-line mastery. Practice them regularly, and you'll become more efficient in CTFs, penetration testing, and general system administration.

Remember: **With great power comes great responsibility.** Always have permission before testing on systems you don't own!
