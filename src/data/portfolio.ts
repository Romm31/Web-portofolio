// --- PROFILE TEXT ---
export const PROFILE_SUMMARY = `
I’m Erwin Wijaya, an Informatics student at Universitas Teknokrat Indonesia and a core member of Tenesys, the university’s Capture The Flag (CTF) team. I’m passionate about cybersecurity, especially in cryptography, web exploitation, and reversing. Competing in CTFs has sharpened my analytical mindset and problem-solving skills in understanding how systems can be both attacked and secured.

Beyond cybersecurity, I enjoy building full-stack applications using Next.js, focusing on creating secure and scalable solutions. I often use AI tools to boost productivity, automate tasks, and accelerate development. My goal is to combine my skills in security and development to create smarter and more reliable systems.
